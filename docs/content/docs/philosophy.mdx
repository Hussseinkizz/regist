title: Philosophy
description: Since regist can be implemented in other languages, it's important to have a shared philosophy.
---

- **Human-first:** Code should read like you think. Explicit, natural, and clear—even when negating.
- **Type-safe and robust:** Full TypeScript, catching errors before runtime.
- **Tested and trusted:** Every feature covered by tests—production ready.
- **Lazy and composable:** Nothing runs until `.try()`. Build, branch, and share chains as needed.
- **Bidirectional chaining:** Switch between assertion and transform logic without friction.
- **Real-world ready:** All the common string checks (email, phone, URL, emoji, etc.), plus leetcode-style utils, are built-in.
- **Reusable and portable:** Compose once, use everywhere, or implement Regist in any language that speaks regex.
- **Zero dependencies:** No bloat, just TypeScript/JavaScript and RegExp.
