## The Challenge with Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions (Regex) are a powerful tool for pattern matching and string manipulation. However, their syntax is often cryptic, making them difficult to write, read, and maintain. This can lead to bugs, technical debt, and a steep learning curve for developers.

## Introducing Regist

```shell
npm install @regist/regist
```

**Regist** is a library designed to simplify string validation and transformation. It provides a declarative, type-safe, and human-readable API that acts as a "friendly syntax sugar" for regular expressions. Think of it as an ORM for strings, abstracting away the complexity of regex while providing a simple, intuitive interface.

With Regist, you can express your intent in an English-like syntax, making your code self-documenting and easy for anyone on your team to understand. No prior knowledge of regex is required to write and maintain complex string-related logic.

## What Regist Is

*   **A Declarative API:** Regist provides a human-readable and friendly syntax for regex.
*   **An Abstraction Layer:** To regex what ORMs are to SQL, simplifying complex operations.
*   **Maintainable:** Turns cryptic regex into a tool that is easy to write and maintain.
*   **Bug Prevention:** Helps prevent regex-related bugs and reduces technical debt.
*   **Expressive:** Allows you to express your intent in a clear, English-like syntax.
*   **Intuitive:** Self-explanatory and easy to use, even for beginners.
*   **Accessible:** No regex knowledge is required to read and write patterns.
*   **Portable:** The design can be implemented in any language that supports regex.

## What Regist Is Not

*   **A Regex Engine:** It uses the native regex engine of the environment it's running in.
*   **A Regex Parser:** It generates regex, but it does not parse it.
*   **A Schema Validation Library:** It is focused exclusively on string validation and transformation, not on validating complex data schemas.

By providing a clear and concise API, Regist empowers developers to handle string manipulations with confidence, leading to more robust and maintainable code.
